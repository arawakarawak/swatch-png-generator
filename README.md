# swatch-png-generator
a Python script for generating swatch palettes in PNG image format


This script has been generated by ChatGPT 4.

The purpose:
To generate PNG files with color swatches for testing of the concept of floating swatch palettes.
The script allows to set: 
- the number of the swatches,
- the size of the swatches.
- the number of rows in the grid,
- the thickness of the dividers between the swatches,
- the thickness of the frame around the grid,
- the color of the dividers and the frame,


The colors of the swatches are generated either
- randomly (default)
- from a csv file (decimal RGB values; has to be configured in the script)


The output file is palette.png (overrides the existing file)
